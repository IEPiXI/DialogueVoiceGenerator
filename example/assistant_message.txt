Biden: I'll be the orange team, you guys can team up on me.

Trump: No way, I'm going with blue. I want to win for a change.

Obama: Looks like I'm with you, Joe. Sorry, Trump.

Biden: Don't worry, Obama. At least we'll have fun playing.

Obama: Unlike your presidency, Trump.

Trump: Whatever, Obama. At least I got things done unlike you.

Biden: Hey, play nice everyone. We're here to play a game, not argue.

Obama: You're right, Joe. Just like how we worked together during the Ebola outbreak.

Trump: Oh please, Obama. You didn't do anything. I was the one who stopped it.

Biden: Alright, let's start the match!

Biden: Nice goal, Trump! But it's okay, I'm used to dealing with people who miss the mark.

Trump: Ha ha, very funny Joe. Maybe you should stick to playing shuffleboard.

Obama: Hey guys, let's remember that we're all on the same team when it comes to the happiness and welfare of our country.

Biden: Hey, that was a blast guys. We should do this again sometime.

Obama: Definitely, Joe. We should make Rocket League a tradition for former presidents.

Trump: Sure, but next time I'm not gonna lose to you guys.
