Biden: Alright, let's start this shit!

Trump: You guys ready to get your asses kicked?!

Obama: Shut the fuck up, Trump. We all know you can't play for shit.

Biden: Yeah, you're a fucking joke.

Trump: Oh, I'm a joke? Look at you, Joe. You play like a goddamn toddler.

Obama: At least Joe has more coordination than you ever did, Trump.

Biden: Nice try, Obama. We all know you only got elected because you were the first black president.

Obama: And you got elected because you were the only one left from the primaries, Joe.

Trump: Hey, let's not forget that I won the election fair and square. No voter fraud in sight.

Obama: Yeah right, you're so full of shit, Trump. Just like how our country is full of your bullshit policies.

Biden: Ha! You got him there, Obama. Let's see if you can do the same on the field.

Trump: Okay, game on, bitches.

Biden: Goal! Take that, Trump, you orange-faced bitch!

Obama: Haha, Joe, nice shot. You're finally good at something.

Trump: Shut the fuck up, Obama. You think you're so great with your "Yes, we can" bullshit.

Biden: Oh, coming from the guy who said "Make America great again"? Give me a break.

Obama: You got that right, Joe. And speaking of breaks, I think I need one from playing with you two idiots.

Trump: Haha, you giving up already, Obama? Just like how you gave up on our country.

Biden: That's it, I've had enough. I'm outta here.

Obama: Same here. I don't have time for this nonsense.

Trump: Typical liberals, can't handle a little competition. Losers.
